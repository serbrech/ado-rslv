# Extension Privacy Policy

## Data Collection

None of the extensions I write collect any data at all. Since no data is collected, none of your data can be used or sold to third parties.

## Changes to the Privacy Policy

If there are substantive<sup>1</sup> changes made to this blanket privacy policy or to the individual privacy policies of any of my extensions, I will push out a new version of the affected extension(s) and ask you to agree to the amended privacy policy.

## Feedback

If you have questions or concerns about this privacy policy, [file an issue](https://github.com/serbrech/ado-rslv/issues/new) to this repository.
